## Environment setup

You need to have [Go](https://go.dev/),
installed on your computer.

Verify the required tools by running the following commands:

```sh
go version
```

## Start in development mode

Navigate to the `main` folder and start the back end:

```sh
cd main
go run main.go
```
The back end will serve on http://localhost:8080.
